## Final game idea

A 2D sidescrolling game about a wizard cursed by his rival. 
The curse is Timewarped and time only moves when he moves (think SuperHot).
The wizard must stop the curse before it consumes him by defeating his rival.
The wizard goes up his rival's tower while encountering all of his rival's minions.

The level has a timer which also acts as a lifesource.
The timer ticks down in correspondance with the timewarp and when you take damage, the timer goes down as well.
